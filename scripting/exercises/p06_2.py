2. Credit Card Number Check
Suppose you have been hired by MeisterCard to write a function 
which checks if a given credit card number is valid. 
Your function check(card_number) should take a string card_number as input.

- First, if the string does not follow the format "#### #### #### ####", where
each # is a digit, it should return False.
- Then, if the sum of the digits is divisible by 10 (a "checksum" method), 
then the procedure should return True, otherwise it should return False.

For example, if card_number is the string "9384 3495 3297 0123" then although
the format is correct, the digitâ€™s sum is 72 so you should return False.

Hints:
- You can split a string at a specific character using the function split().
parts = my_string.split('a')
- You can test if a string contains only digits with the function isdigit().
only_digits = my_string.isdigit()
