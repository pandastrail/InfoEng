P07 Regex

2. Regular expression for URLs

Based on the script v07_regex_contact_data.py discussed in class:

-Design a regular expression to extract a valid URL and add it to the script
- Instead of first occurrence, extract all occurrences of phone numbers, 
emails and URLs
- Refactor your code to using functions for extracting all phone numbers, email
addresses and URLs
- Test your code on email-footer.txt

Hint:look up re.findall()
