This is a temporary script file.

P05 â€“ File I/O, Network I/O and JSON
1. File I/O
1.1 Change File Extension
Write a program that unifies the filename endings of MP3 songs
(.mp3 and .MP3) for all songs in a given folder to .mp3. 
Download the zip file containing the test data (these
are empty files, not actual songs) and extract it to a folder.

Hints:
- Make sure you import the module os: import os
- You can get a list of the files in a folder using
os.listdir(<path_to_folder>)
- You can rename a file using
os.rename(<old_filename>, <new_filename>)
- Research string methods (help(str)), e.g. replace(), endswith() or
join()
